# EV3-Domino_line_tracing_robot

Project for 'DOMINO LINE TRACING ROBOT with EV3'. We used LEGO® MINDSTORMS® Education EV3 Core Set. If you want to know about it more, you can visit https://education.lego.com/en-us/products/lego-mindstorms-education-ev3-core-set/5003400. This robot follow the BLACK line and build domino blocks beside line. You can see more detail image and video below.

# About this Project
### 1.Getting Started
Firstly, you should have EV3 and make robot with it. In my repository I don't have any blueprint. So if you want to make same as this robot, you should see picture narrowly. I think it will not be hard.
Here are some detail pictures.

'line_tracing_with_domino.c' is using 'Robot C'. If you plan to make robot with EV3 than it will be easy to use it.

### 2.How to make it
It is very simple. You have to prepare EV3, some domino blocks and map. When you make robot you need two color sensors, two Large motors and one medium motor.
After making robot it is easy. Firstly, you should put code in your EV3 robot. Don't forget that you should use EV3 with Robot C. Second, put some dominos in the robot's fence. Maybe fence can be on your right or left. Lastly, put your robot on the map. This map should be drawn with BLACK color pen on the white paper. Because it recognize track with Color Sensor.

### 3.Limitations
This robot is very good at setting up some domino blocks follow to line but it has some limitations. First, our purpose was make it recognize at least 3 colors and put each color block. However because of width it cannot work. Second there is limitation number of block, can build up. Because to fix fence, we should make it up to robot's body. Additionally, don't forget to make ㅗ shape block. You should put it behind piled up blocks to support them.
